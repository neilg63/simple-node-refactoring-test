# Simple Node Refactoring Test with Nest JS

You will need access to an environment with Node JS 20+. The latest LTS version of Node (24.12.0) will be fine.
The first step is to install the project via `npm install`. There are no external database dependencies. The default port is 3000, but you can override this in your local `.env` file or within `main.ts`.
 
The controller in `src/survey.controller.ts` has one endpoint method, `renderResults()`, which is called when you navigate to `/survey/results` (e.g. http://localhost:3000/survey/results). This calls `survey.result.ts` and the related `answer.row.ts` and `completion.row.ts` model files. In normal *Nest* projects, these would be organised into separate modules. 

All data sets and variable values are hard-coded for testing purposes. In production, these would come from request parameters and database queries.

A user, Jane Blogger, identified by `userId`, is answering questions in a survey identified by `surveyId`. So far, she has answered 3 questions, 1 in the personal category and 2 in the career category. The current survey has 3 personal questions and 9 career questions. Each question has one answer.

This output should show status (success, invalid), the answers given so far and the percentage completed by category key.

The mock data is assembled in `survey.result.ts` with only two categories, but in future there may be many more categories and the output should track progress as a  % within each category, including those the candidate has not begun yet.

The API endpoint `/survey/results` would be called by a frontend application with a payload containing the `surveyId`. The `userId` may come from a JWT token; However, we have hardcoded these values for temporary testing purposes.

Your task is only to:

1. Implement the `calcPercentage()` method in the `CompletionRow` service class (`completion.row.ts`)
2. Run `npm run test` to see if the second test passes.
3. Refactor the code in `renderResults()` (`survey.controller.ts`) with a SurveyService class (`survey.service.ts`) returning a `Details` object (currently defined as an interface in completions.row.ts)  with improvements to better support more question categories in future. However, the output within `progress` should still be in the format:
```json
{
  "category_1": 50,
  "category_2": 0
}
```
4. Run `npm run test` again to check both tests still pass.
