# Simple Node Refactoring Test with Nest JS

The first step is to install the project via `npm install`. This should install a skeleton Nest Js 11 project that requires Node 20+, but has no other dependencies such as databases. The default port is 3000, but you can override this in your local `.env` file.
 
The controller in `src/survey.controller.ts` has method, `renderResults()`, which is called when you navigate to `/survey/results` (e.g. http://localhost:3000/survey/results). This calls `src/survey.service.ts` and the related `completion.row.ts` model files. In normal Nest projects, these would be organised into separate modules. 

All data sets and variable values are hard-coded for testing purposes. In production, these would come from request parameters and database queries.

A user, Jane Blogger, identified by $userId, is answering questions in a survey identified by `surveyId`. So far, she has answered 3 questions, 1 in the personal category and 2 in the career category. The current survey has 3 personal questions and 9 career questions. Each question has one answer.

This output should show status (success, invalid), the percentage completed by category key and the answers given so far. 

The API endpoint `/survey/results` would be called by a frontend application with a payload containing the ```surveyId```. The ```userId``` may come from a JWT token; However, we have hardcoded these values for temporary testing purposes.

Your task is only to:

1. Refactor the code within ```renderResults()``` (src/survey.controller.ts)
2. Implement the calcPercentage() method in the ```CompletionRow``` service class (src/comnpletion.row.ts)
3. Suggest improvements to the models to support more question categories in future.
